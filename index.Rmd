### About me

I am a researcher working at the **Wyss Academy for Nature**, where I focus on the political economy of land use, environmental governance, and conflict. My work examines how institutions, power, and property relations shape environmental outcomes, with a particular emphasis on fragile and conflict-affected settings.
