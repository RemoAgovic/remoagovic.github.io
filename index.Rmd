### Background

I am a PhD candidate at the Institute for Political Science and the Wyss Academy for Nature at the University of Bern. I hold a BSc in Economics from the University of Bern and an MSc in Economics from the University of Zurich, with a specialization in development and policy. My research is grounded in political science and political economy, with a focus on environmental governance and development. My dissertation examines the political economy of community-based conservation, with a focus on how conservation arrangements interact with political behavior and institutional outcomes. Methodologically, I am particularly interested in causal inference and apply econometric and geospatial methods to study human–environment interactions.
